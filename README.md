# Embedding Java Classes with code2vec: Improvements from Variable Obfuscation

![Overall project view](img/overall.png)

Code for the paper: *Embedding Java Classes with code2vec: Improvements from Variable Obfuscation* (paper link coming soon!)

This repository contains links to all data and models used in the paper, code for the dataset pipeline, as well as the obfuscation tool used for obfuscating the datasets.

All of the model-related code (`common.py`, `model.py`, `PathContextReader.py`) as well as the `JavaExtractor` folder is code from the original [code2vec repository](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec). This was used for invoking the trained code2vec models to create method embeddings - using the code2vec model as a feature extractor.

## Requirements
- Java 8+
- Python 3

## Usage - Obfuscator
1. `cd java-obfuscator`
1. Locate a folder of `.java` files (e.g., from the [code2seq](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq) repository)
2. Alter the input and output directories in `obfs-script.sh`, as well as the number of threads of your machine. If you're running this on a particularly large folder (e.g., millions of files) then you may need to increase the `NUM_PARTITIONS` to 3 or 4, otherwise memory issues can occur, grinding the obfuscator to a near halt.
3. Run `obfs-script.sh` i.e. `$ source obfs-script.sh`

This will result in a new obfuscated folder of `.java` files, that can be used to train a new obfuscated code2vec model (or any model that performs learning from source code for that matter).

## Usage - Dataset Pipeline

![Dataset Pipeline View](img/pipeline.png)

These steps will convert a classification dataset of `.java` files into a numerical form (`.arff` by default), that can then be used with any standard WEKA classifier.

The dataset should be in the form of those supplied with this paper i.e.:
```
dataset_name
|-- class1
    |-- file1.java
    |-- file2.java
    ...
|-- class2
    |-- file251.java
    |-- file252.java
    ...

...
```

To run the dataset pipeline and create class-level embeddings for a dataset of Java files:
1. `cd pipeline`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Download a `.java` dataset (from the datasets supplied or your own) and put in the `java_files/` directory
2. Download a code2vec model checkpoint and put the checkpoint folder in the `models/` directory
3. Change the paths and definitions in `model_defs.py` and number of models in `scripts/create_datasets.sh` to match your setup
4. Run `create_datasets.sh` (`source scripts/create_datasets.sh`). This will loop through each model and create class-level embeddings for the supplied datasets. The resulting datasets will be in `.arff` format in the `weka_files/` folder. 

You can now perform class-level classification on the dataset using any off-the-shelf WEKA classifier.

### Config
By default the pipeline will use the full range of values for each parameter, which creates a huge number of resulting `.arff` datasets (>1000). To reduce the number of these, remove (or comment out) some of the items in the arrays in `reduction_methods.py` and `selection_methods.py` (at the end of the file). Our experiments showed that the `SelectAll` selection method and `NoReduction` reduction method performed best in most cases so you may want to just keep these.

## Models

The models can all be downloaded [from zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3577367).

The `.java` datasets used to train each of the models (different versions of `java-large` from the [code2seq repository](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq)), as well as the preprocessed code2vec-ready versions of those datasets are also available: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CXgSXKf292BTlryASui2kBvYvJSvFnWN)

## Datasets

The `.java` datasets are all [available for download](https://zenodo.org/record/3575197). 

For the interactive embedding visualisations, best results are often seen by UMAP.

#### Notes

`*` - 2000 samples per class were randomly sampled during experiments, so the results in the paper are reported on a smaller dataset. The downloadable dataset is the full version.
